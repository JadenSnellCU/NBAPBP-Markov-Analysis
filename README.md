# NBA Markov Chain Analysis

This project analyzes **NBA play-by-play data** using **Markov chains** to model game dynamics, estimate **expected points**, determine the **probability of a comeback**, and compute **absorbing state probabilities** (win/loss outcomes). The analysis is based on historical NBA game data and leverages transition matrices and probability models to provide insights into in-game strategy and performance.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
1. **Expected Points Calculation**  
   - Estimate the expected number of points scored given a game state (possession, score difference, time left).
  
2. **Probability of a Comeback**  
   - Compute the likelihood of a team overcoming a deficit based on transition probabilities.

3. **Absorbing State Probabilities**  
   - Determine how likely a game ends in a win or loss for a given score difference and time remaining.
